# Cafe-App
**My first reactnative app.  I used redux for state management and for back-end I used my own rest-api which I build with spring framework.

*I tried to make a small yelp app.
*The app allow people to comment on cafes and give them like so people know which place is the best for them -


**Screenshots of the app :
